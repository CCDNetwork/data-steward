# CCD Data Stewardship Platform

## Name
Welcome to the CCD Data Stewardship Platform.

## Background
This platform was developed as part of the CCD's [data interoperability project](https://www.collaborativecash.org/data-interoperability). It is part of a toolkit intended to enable humanitarian organisations to manage data on a collective basis, to enable aid organisations to share data more responsibly to provide more accountability towards aid recipients. This README will be expanded in the near future, including an Admin Guide and a User Manual.

## Features
The platform provides three main functions:

1. Deduplication of individuals and assistance
2. Referrals between aid organisations
3. Access to their own data for aid recipients

## Installation
The platform is intended to be hosted by a humanitarian organisation acting as a Data Host on behalf of a consortium. The server requirements are likely to be:

- VPS or dedicated server
- 4GB of RAM
- 40 GB of storage
- Ubuntu 20.04
- SSH access with root or sudo
